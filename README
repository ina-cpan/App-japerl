  App::japerl - JPerl-again Perl glocalization scripting environment

SYNOPSIS

  japerl [switches] [--] script.pl [arguments]

DESCRIPTION

  japerl was created with the intention of succeeding JPerl.
  japerl provides glocalization script environment on both modern Perl
  and traditional Perl by using Char::* software family.

  This is often misunderstood, but japerl and jacode.pl have different
  purposes and functions.

       software
  <<elder   younger>>     software purpose
  ----------------------+---------------------------------------
  jcode.pl  jacode.pl   | to convert encoding of data for I/O
  ----------------------+---------------------------------------
  jperl     japerl.bat  | to execute native encoding scripts
                        | (NEVER convert script encoding)
  ----------------------+---------------------------------------

  This software can do the following.
  - choose one perl interpreter in system
  - select local use libraries
  - execute script written in system native encoding

  May you do good magic with japerl.
